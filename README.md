# Spotify Song App

A React Native app to get your list of albums from Spotify and leave notes about them.

The app does the following:

1.  Authenticate with the chosen API. For quick turn around for this proof of concept(POC), the app utilizes [Spotify App Remote](https://cjam.github.io/react-native-spotify-remote/index.html) for authentication. This third party library provided minimal alterations to native files, resulting in quicker turn around to develop POC. Going forward, this library could support session management and playback. Alternatively, the native Spotify SDK could be explored to handle app autonomy and handling complex features requirements.

2.  Once authenticated with your Spotify account, the app will pull a list of your albums and display them in a list view.

3.  Within each album listed, you have the ability to add a note (NOTE: Data is posted to a dummy API endpoint usingÂ https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide.html. In this example, each note is assigned with a id that's associated with each album.

## Installation

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Xcode and Android Studio.

```

### Android

```
npx react-native run-android
```

# Challenges & Learnings

There were some roadblocks along the way, leading to it taking much longer than I expected:

Challenges:

1. Personal Macbook and setup of development environment (XCode, Android Studio)
2. General tooling not setup, linters, formatters, plugins. Prone to unexplainable errors.
3. Determining dependencies.
4. Documentation took time going through.React Native integration with Spotify. Third party library documentation wasn't up to date, leading to unnecessary instruction and additional errors to solve.

Learnings:

1. Integration with Spotify (OAuth)
2. Mocking data/data relationships
3. New tooling and libraries

# GOING FORWARD:

1. Establish better tooling: `Typescript`, 'JSX'
2. Establish Navigation Library: `React Naviation` or `React Native Navigation`
3. Break pieces of code into separate directories: `components`, `services`, `utils`, `models`, `assets`, etc.
4. Better state management: `Redux`, `Context`
5. Better UI tools: `React Native Elements`
6. Establish better data schemas
7. Testing: `Jest`, `Unit`, `e2e`
