About this app

• Authenticate with the chosen API.
• Pull a list of your albums (or repositories) and display them in a list view.
• When you tap one, it will open a form that allows you to add your own notes.
• This form will post to a dummy API endpoint using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide.html that you must create.
• Alternatively, you may use an API endpoint of your choosing or creation if that suits you.
